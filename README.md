    This repository contains 2 seperate projects.

## Knight's Tour Problem
- Different approaches to solve the Knight's Tour Problem. Breadth-first, Deep-first, Deep-first with heuristic search algorithms are implemented to find a legit solution.

## Maximum Weighted Independent Set Problem
- In this project, we are asked to implement Genetic Algorithm for the Maximum Weighted Independent Set Problem. This program returns a binary string as output which is indicating that each zero in the graph represents independent vertices of the given graph. In addition, each generation’s average fitness value can be seen above the returned binary string.
- In the genetic algorithm, certain steps were clear and what we’ve done were simply applying these algorithms in our code such as Roulette Selection Method, One-Point Crossover or Ten-Point Mutation, etc.
- The unique part of our program is “Repair Function” which provides us feasible solutions after crossover and mutation operations carry out.
